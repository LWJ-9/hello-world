Always good to learn something new

Hi!

Finally I sign-upped at the famous github site.
I find myself very excited when learning computer hardware & software techonology and the architecture design of it.
I may lack of some skills about imagination , but that wont stop me doing little Tech.
I'm currently learning javascript/css/php/mysql , hope I'm lucky.
English might become my third language, cuz Im now living at japan , I'm a chinese tho.
Im 25, Im at school, and Im starving, why one unit will last 90minutes.
